# Putting the Domain Model to Work

__Model__: Every model represents some aspect of reality or an idea that is of interest. It is an interpretation of reality that abstracts the aspects relevant to solving the problem at hand and ignores extraneous detail.

__Domain__ :Every software program relates to some activity or interest of its user. That subject area to which the user applies the program is the domain of the software.

A model is a selectively simplified and consciously structured form of knowledge.

A domain model is not a particular diagram; it is the idea that the diagram is intended to convey. it is a rigorously organized and selective abstraction of that knowledge

## The Utility of a Model in Domain-Driven Design
1. __The model and the heart of the design shape each other.__, This binding of model and implementation also helps during maintenance and continuing development
2. __The model is the backbone of a language used by all team members.__
3. __The model is distilled knowledge.__

## The Heart of Software

> The heart of software is its ability to solve domain-related problems for its user.

## Ingredients of Effective Modeling
1. __Binding the model and the implementation.__
2. __Cultivating a language based on the model.__
3. __Developing a knowledge-rich model.__
4. __Distilling the model.__
5. __Brainstorming and experimenting__

It is the creativity of brainstorming and massive experimentation, leveraged through a model-based language and disciplined by the feedback loop through implementation, that makes it possible to find a knowledge-rich model and distill it

> Good programmers will naturally start to abstract and develop a model that can do more work

## Deep Model
Useful models seldom lie on the surface. As we come to understand the domain and the needs of the application, we usually discard superficial model elements that seemed important in the beginning, or we shift their perspective
