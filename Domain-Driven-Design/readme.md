# Putting the Domain Model to Work

__Model__: Every model represents some aspect of reality or an idea that is of interest. It is an interpretation of reality that abstracts the aspects relevant to solving the problem at hand and ignores extraneous detail.

__Domain__ :Every software program relates to some activity or interest of its user. That subject area to which the user applies the program is the domain of the software.

A model is a selectively simplified and consciously structured form of knowledge.

A domain model is not a particular diagram; it is the idea that the diagram is intended to convey. it is a rigorously organized and selective abstraction of that knowledge

## The Utility of a Model in Domain-Driven Design
1. __The model and the heart of the design shape each other.__, This binding of model and implementation also helps during maintenance and continuing development
2. __The model is the backbone of a language used by all team members.__
3. __The model is distilled knowledge.__

## The Heart of Software

> The heart of software is its ability to solve domain-related problems for its user.
