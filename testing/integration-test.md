# Integration test
## Do
1. Consider the cost vs. benefit of each test
2. Test using all the same steps your customers will perform
3. Ensure Well-defined Test Strategy
4. Have a good Software Configuration Management system
5. design for concurrency


## Dont
1. Write an integration test when a unit test suffices
2. Integration testing should not involve testing functionality
3. Integration testing and unit testing should not overlap
4. Test cases should not be too complex
5. Integration test cases should not test beyond the Requirement Acceptance Criteria
6. rely on existing data
